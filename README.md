# GCD8141 Computational Genomics

## About this course

Genomic data is increasingly prevalent in todayâ€™s biological research. The ability to understand, analyze, and interpret genomic data is now an important skill that is valuable for anyone seeking a career in biology. The purpose of this class is to provide students a familiarity with different areas of genomics through discussion of seminal papers and hands-on analysis of common types of genomics data. 

## Learning Objectives

1. Have a broad view of the field of genomics, including current technologies and its applications to biological and biomedical questions.
2. Be able to critically review research papers and appreciate issues in study design, replicability, significance, and artifacts in genomics.
3. Communicate clearly and effectively the results of your own analysis, as well as other scientific papers.
4. Be familiar with basic computer programming and data analysis/visualization skills using the Python and R languages. 
5. Be able to use bioinformatics pipelines in a UNIX-based environment on the Minnesota Supercomputer Institute (MSI) cluster system.
6. Have experience with analysis and interpretation of genomic data, and understand some of the practical issues involved.
